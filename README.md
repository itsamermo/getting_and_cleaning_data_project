##Transformation steps:

###Cleaning Data steps:
* clean up the spaces delimiting data and split data into columns
* filter out any true blank columns and rows(with all values being blank)
* We name the variables in training and test data sets with list of names from features.txt
* Adding activity labels  from y_train.txt and y_test.txt files to train and test data sets 
* Adding subject lables  from subject_train.txt and subject_test.txt files to train and test data sets 

###Data Preparation steps:
* Merging train and test  data sets vertically.
* Extracted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* converting all means and std columns to class numeric
* merge this data set horizontally with activity_labels.txt to get training activity class descriptions

###I/O steps: 
* below are the commands executed at R console to write data set to disk before upload to github.
* write.csv(tdydt, file = "C:/Users/smohampc/Documents/Coursera/getting_and_cleaning_data/project/avg_tidy_data.txt",row.names=FALSE)
* write.csv(my_data, file = "C:/Users/smohampc/Documents/Coursera/getting_and_cleaning_data/project/tidy_data.txt",row.names=FALSE)


The final datasets/Files 	| 	Details

 'README.txt'		|
 'codebook.txt'		| contains variable categories and naming terminology for each variable
 'features.txt'		| list of varaibles for tidy data set
 'tidy_data.txt'	| tidy data set as a result of merging raw train and raw test data sets and subsetting by variables relating to mean and standard deviation measurements
 'avg_tidy_data.txt'| shows averages of  each variable for each activity and each subject of data set tidy_data.txt
